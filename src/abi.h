/// \file abi.h Arrow C-Data Interface
///
/// The Arrow C-Data interface defines a very small, stable set
/// of C definitions which can be easily copied into any project's
/// source code and vendored to be used for columnar data interchange
/// in the Arrow format. For non-C/C++ languages and runtimes,
/// it should be almost as easy to translate the C definitions into
/// the corresponding C FFI declarations.
///
/// Applications and libraries can therefore work with Arrow memory
/// without necessarily using the Arrow libraries or reinventing
/// the wheel. Developers can choose between tight integration
/// with the Arrow software project or minimal integration with
/// the Arrow format only.
